system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are m containers, in the i-th container there are ai matchboxes, and each matchbox contains bi matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold n matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than n matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·108) and integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 20). The i + 1-th line contains a pair of numbers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai ≤ 108, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10). All the input numbers are integer.

Output

Output the only number — answer to the problem.

assistant: To analyze the performance bottleneck in the given C program, we need to assess how the code behaves differently under the "slow" input compared to the "fast" input. Based on the provided information, we can follow the outlined phases to derive performance-characterizing invariants.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-level Hit Counts**:
   - The line hit counts reveal significant differences between the slow and fast inputs, particularly in the loop starting at line 40. Here, the `while` loop runs significantly more times for the slow input.

2. **Pinpointing Lines with High Hit Counts**:
   - Line 40: The condition `while (counter < v[i].first && t--)` is hit 111,823,020 times for the slow input and only 2 times for the fast input.
   - Lines 41, 42, 43: These lines are also executed 111,823,018 times for the slow input, which indicates that these lines are contributing heavily to the slow performance.

3. **Inference on Code Interaction**:
   - The nested loop that sorts containers based on the number of matches per box seems inefficient but is not the primary bottleneck since its hit count is low relative to the main computation loop.
   - The main issue arises from the large difference in the number of matchboxes (`n = 200,000,000` for the slow input) and the total number of matchboxes available (`m = 2`). This mismatch leads to excessive iterations in the `while` loop, causing the slowdown.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the observations, we can derive the following performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **Invariant 1**: "When the number of matchboxes `n` is significantly larger than the total number of matchboxes available from all containers, the program enters a slow path. This typically happens when `n` approaches its upper constraint and `m` or the `ai` values are relatively small, leading to excessive iterations in the loop."

2. **Invariant 2**: "If the sum of matchboxes across all containers is much smaller than `n`, the `while` loop iterates extensively, causing performance degradation. This situation is exacerbated when the containers have relatively few matchboxes compared to the capacity `n`."

3. **Invariant 3**: "When the sorting step is performed on a small number of containers with significant differences in matchboxes per container, it may not be the primary performance issue, but it can add to the inefficiency if combined with large `n` and small `m` values."

These statements aim to capture the conditions that lead to the observed slowdown, particularly focusing on the imbalance between the required number of matchboxes (`n`) and their availability in the containers. The invariants suggest that future slowdowns are likely when the input pattern involves a large `n` with comparatively few matchboxes available across all containers (`m` and `ai` values are small).

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are m containers, in the i-th container there are ai matchboxes, and each matchbox contains bi matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold n matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than n matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·108) and integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 20). The i + 1-th line contains a pair of numbers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai ≤ 108, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10). All the input numbers are integer.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Below are the code snippets implementing the performance-characterizing invariants derived in natural language:

1. **Invariant 1**: Check if `n` is significantly larger than the total number of matchboxes available, leading to excessive iterations.

```cpp
void check_large_n_invariant(int n, int m, const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& v) {
    long long totalBoxes = 0;
    for (const auto& container : v) {
        totalBoxes += container.first;
    }
    if (n > 10 * totalBoxes) { // A threshold to signify excessive mismatch
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is much larger than available matchboxes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

2. **Invariant 2**: Check if the sum of matchboxes across containers is much smaller than `n`.

```cpp
void check_small_total_boxes_invariant(int n, int m, const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& v) {
    long long totalBoxes = 0;
    for (const auto& container : v) {
        totalBoxes += container.first;
    }
    if (totalBoxes < n / 10) { // A threshold to signify insufficient matchboxes
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient matchboxes compared to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating the Checkers into the Original C++ Program

Below is the original C++ solution code with the integrated performance checkers:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to check the invariant where n is much larger than available matchboxes
void check_large_n_invariant(int n, int m, const vector<pair<int, int>>& v) {
    long long totalBoxes = 0;
    for (const auto& container : v) {
        totalBoxes += container.first;
    }
    if (n > 10 * totalBoxes) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - n is much larger than available matchboxes!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Function to check the invariant where there are insufficient matchboxes compared to n
void check_small_total_boxes_invariant(int n, int m, const vector<pair<int, int>>& v) {
    long long totalBoxes = 0;
    for (const auto& container : v) {
        totalBoxes += container.first;
    }
    if (totalBoxes < n / 10) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - insufficient matchboxes compared to n!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    vector<pair<int, int>> v;
    cin >> n;
    int m;
    cin >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int x, y;
        cin >> x >> y;
        pair<int, int> p(x, y);
        v.push_back(p);
    }

### Explanation

- **Check Placement**: Both checks are placed after the input is read and before entering the main computation part of the program, ensuring they don't add overhead to any performance-critical loop.
- **Thresholds**: The thresholds in the checks are arbitrary but intended to catch conditions where `n` is disproportionately large compared to available matchboxes, ensuring they capture potential bottlenecks effectively.
