system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Example

Input


7
1
2
3
4
5
6
12


Output


FastestFinger
Ashishgup
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

(F) Program Solving the Problem Statement

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    int n, m = 1;
    cin >> n;
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
      n /= 2;
      m *= 2;
    }
    int x = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
      if (n % i == 0) x = 0;
    }
    if ((n == 1 && m != 2) || (n != 1 && m == 2 && x))
      cout << "FastestFinger";
    else
      cout << "Ashishgup";
    cout << endl;
  }
}

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

From comparing the line-level hit counts between the fast and slow inputs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Lines 9-11**: These lines are responsible for dividing `n` by 2 repeatedly until `n` is no longer even. The hit counts are relatively high for both inputs, indicating that many numbers are being heavily reduced by powers of two. However, the difference in hit counts between slow and fast inputs is not very significant here.

2. **Lines 14-15**: These lines involve a loop that checks for odd divisors of `n`. The hit count difference is significant between slow (15,551 hits) and fast (1,432 hits) inputs. This suggests that, for the slow input, the loop is running many more times, indicating numbers that have more factors or are larger primes.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Iterations with Odd Divisors**: 
   - Natural language description: "When `n` has multiple or large odd divisors, especially if `n` is a large composite number or a large prime number, the loop will iterate many times, increasing the computation time significantly."
   - This relates to slow cases where `n` is large and has complex factor structures, causing the inner loop on lines 14-15 to execute extensively.

2. **Repeated Division by Two**:
   - Natural language description: "If `n` starts as a high power of two, the initial while-loop will run many iterations, but this is less of a bottleneck compared to the odd divisor loop."
   - While this can cause many iterations, the impact is more uniform and not as significant in differentiating slow from fast inputs based on hit counts.

3. **Prime Numbers**:
   - Natural language description: "If `n` is large and prime, the check for odd divisors (line 14) will iterate over many possible divisors, leading to increased execution time."
   - This is because the loop will attempt to check divisibility by each number up to the square root of `n`.

4. **Composite Numbers with Large Factors**:
   - Natural language description: "When `n` is a composite number with large odd factors, especially if it remains large after the initial division by two, it can lead to more iterations in both the divisor checking and reduction logic."
   - Such configurations can force the loop to consider many potential divisors.

These invariants help in identifying conditions under which the program might slow down, providing a guide for optimizing or altering input structures for better performance.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 

They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:

  * Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. 
  * Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. 



Divisors of a number include the number itself.

The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer — n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Example

Input


7
1
2
3
4
5
6
12


Output


FastestFinger
Ashishgup
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup
FastestFinger
Ashishgup

Note

In the first test case, n = 1, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.

In the second test case, n = 2, Ashishgup subtracts 1 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the third test case, n = 3, Ashishgup divides by 3 on the first move. Now n = 1, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.

In the last test case, n = 12, Ashishgup divides it by 3. Now n = 4, FastestFinger is forced to subtract 1, and Ashishgup gets 3, so he wins by dividing it by 3.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implement the Natural Language Invariants in C++

Here are the C++ checker code snippets for each of the identified performance-characterizing invariants:

1. **High Iterations with Odd Divisors**:
   ```cpp
   void check_odd_divisors_invariant(int n, int iterations) {
       // Assuming a threshold of 1000 for iterations as a broad threshold
       if (iterations > 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iterations with odd divisors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Repeated Division by Two** (not really a bottleneck in this case, so not implemented as a separate check).

3. **Prime Numbers**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_prime_invariant(int n) {
       // If n is a large prime, it will take longer to confirm it has no divisors
       // Check if n is larger than a typical threshold for being "large"
       if (n > 1000000 && is_prime(n)) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large prime!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }

   bool is_prime(int n) {
       if (n <= 1) return false;
       for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
           if (n % i == 0) return false;
       }
       return true;
   }
   ```

4. **Composite Numbers with Large Factors**:
   ```cpp
   void check_large_composite_invariant(int n, int m) {
       // Check specific conditions for n and m
       if (n > 1000000 && m > 1000) {
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large composite with big factors!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrate Checker Code into the Original Program

Now, let's integrate these performance checks into the original C++ code, ensuring they do not introduce overhead in critical loops:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Performance checker functions
void check_odd_divisors_invariant(int n, int iterations) {
    if (iterations > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - high iterations with odd divisors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

void check_large_prime_invariant(int n) {
    if (n > 1000000 && is_prime(n)) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large prime!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_large_composite_invariant(int n, int m) {
    if (n > 1000000 && m > 1000) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - large composite with big factors!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n, m = 1;
        cin >> n;

        // Check for primes
        check_large_prime_invariant(n);

        int iteration_count = 0;
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
            m *= 2;
            iteration_count++;
        }

        // Evaluate the number of iterations for divisor checks
        check_odd_divisors_invariant(n, iteration_count);

        int x = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {

### Explanation of Integration

- The checkers are placed after significant computation points: after reading `n`, after reducing `n` by powers of two, and after prime/composite checks.
- The `is_prime` function checks primality, used in performance checks.
- The checks avoid being in loops to minimize overhead.
- Each checker function has a specific role in identifying potential performance bottlenecks.
