system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him tj minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·109).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values tj (1 ≤ tj ≤ 1000000), where tj is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.

Output

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.

Note

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

assistant: Based on the provided code, problem statement, and hit count data, we can identify potential performance bottlenecks and then derive natural language performance-characterizing invariants. Let's go through the phases:

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Loop Overhead:**
   - The outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < int(n + 1); ++i)`) has a significantly higher hit count for the slow input (28 hits) compared to the fast input (3 hits). This suggests that this loop contributes heavily to the slowdown.
   - The inner loop controlled by `for (int j = int(i); j < int(n); ++j)` (540 hits for slow input) and its nested loop `for (int p = 0; p < int(k); ++p)` (3591 hits for slow input) indicate that these loops are executed many times, potentially causing the slowdown.

2. **Sorting Operations:**
   - The `sort(task.begin(), task.end())` call is hit 27 times in the slow input compared to 2 times in the fast input. This sorting operation inside the loop can be costly, especially when the `task` vector is large.

3. **Task Vector Growth:**
   - The `task.push_back({t[p], p})` line is responsible for constructing the `task` vector multiple times (3078 hits for slow input), indicating that the size of this vector grows significantly during execution, which in turn affects sorting time.

4. **Resource Allocation and Reduction:**
   - The loop over `task.size()` (hit 2574 times for slow input) suggests that many operations are performed to update `r`, `pl`, and `k0`.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Nested Loop Impact:**
   - **Invariant:** "When both n and k are close to their maximum values (45), the multiple nested loops result in excessive iterations, leading to performance degradation."

2. **Task Vector Size:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the number of tasks (`n`) is large, the `task` vector grows significantly, leading to repeated sorting of a large list which can slow down execution."

3. **Sorting as Bottleneck:**
   - **Invariant:** "When a large number of subtasks (controlled by `k`) leads to a repeatedly resorted `task` vector, performance may degrade due to increased sorting overhead."

4. **Residual Time Management:**
   - **Invariant:** "If the available time (`M`) is such that many subtasks can be partially attempted, the loop iterations increase, leading to potential slowdowns from excessive recalculations."

By monitoring these conditions, a fuzzer or developer can better understand scenarios where performance issues might arise and optimize accordingly. Always ensure these checks avoid tight loops to prevent additional overhead.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him tj minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·109).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values tj (1 ≤ tj ≤ 1000000), where tj is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.

Output

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.

Note

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.

Solution (C++ code):
{solution}


assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing the Inferred Invariants in C++

Based on the natural language performance-characterizing invariants derived previously, here are the corresponding C++ checker codes:

1. **Nested Loop Impact:**
   ```cpp
   void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int k) {
       if (n >= 40 && k >= 40) {  // Threshold for significant nested loop impact
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Task Vector Size:**
   ```cpp
   void check_task_vector_size(int taskSize) {
       if (taskSize > 1500) {  // Threshold for large task vector impacting performance
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - task vector too large!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Sorting as Bottleneck:**
   ```cpp
   void check_sort_bottleneck(int taskSize, int sortCount) {
       if (taskSize > 1000 && sortCount > 20) {  // Threshold for sorting overhead
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive sorting of large data!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Residual Time Management:**
   ```cpp
   void check_residual_time_management(int availableTime, int maxTime) {
       if (availableTime < maxTime / 10) {  // Arbitrary threshold for low residual time causing excessive calculations
           cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient use of residual time!" << endl;
           abort();
       }
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Original Program

Now, we will integrate these checks into the original C++ program:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Performance-check functions for detecting potential bottlenecks.
void check_nested_loop_invariant(int n, int k) {
    if (n >= 40 && k >= 40) {  // Threshold for significant nested loop impact
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive nested loop iterations!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_task_vector_size(int taskSize) {
    if (taskSize > 1500) {  // Threshold for large task vector impacting performance
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - task vector too large!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_sort_bottleneck(int taskSize, int sortCount) {
    if (taskSize > 1000 && sortCount > 20) {  // Threshold for sorting overhead
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - excessive sorting of large data!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void check_residual_time_management(int availableTime, int maxTime) {
    if (availableTime < maxTime / 10) {  // Arbitrary threshold for low residual time causing excessive calculations
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered - inefficient use of residual time!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    int n, k, m;
    cin >> n >> k >> m;
    vector<int> t(k);
    long long sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < int(k); ++i) {
        cin >> t[i];
        sum += t[i];
    }

    // Check nested loop impact
    check_nested_loop_invariant(n, k);

    int mx = 0;
    int sortCount = 0; // To track the number of sorting operations

    for (int i = 0; i < int(n + 1); ++i) {
        long long tm = sum * i;
        if (tm > m) break;
        int r = m - tm;
        int k0 = k * i + i;
        vector<pair<int, int>> task;

        for (int j = int(i); j < int(n); ++j) {
            for (int p = 0; p < int(k); ++p) {
                task.push_back({t[p], p});
            }
        }

        // Check task vector size
        check_task_vector_size(task.size());

        sort(task.begin(), task.end());
        sortCount++;

        // Check sorting bottleneck
        check_sort_bottleneck(task.size(), sortCount);

        vector<int> pl(k);
        for (int j = 0; j < task.size() && r - task[j].first >= 0; j++) {
            pl[task[j].second]++;
            r -= task[j].first;
            k0++;
        }

        // Check residual time management
        check_residual_time_management(r, m);

        int z = pl[0];
        for (int j = 0; j < int(k); ++j) {
            z = min(z, pl[j]);
        }
        k0 += z;
        mx = max(mx, k0);
    }

    cout << mx << '\n';
}
```

### Explanation

- **Nested Loop Impact Check**: This is placed after reading inputs since it relates to the sizes of `n` and `k`, which determine loop iterations.
  
- **Task Vector Size & Sorting Bottleneck Checks**: These are placed inside the main loop where `task` is constructed and sorted, respectively, as they directly relate to the growth and usage of the task vector.
  
- **Residual Time Management Check**: This check is placed after recalculating the residual time `r`, ensuring that performance issues due to low time are highlighted correctly.
