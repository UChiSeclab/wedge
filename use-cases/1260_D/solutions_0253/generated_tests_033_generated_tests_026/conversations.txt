system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

You are playing a computer game, where you lead a party of m soldiers. Each soldier is characterised by his agility a_i.

The level you are trying to get through can be represented as a straight line segment from point 0 (where you and your squad is initially located) to point n + 1 (where the boss is located).

The level is filled with k traps. Each trap is represented by three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i. l_i is the location of the trap, and d_i is the danger level of the trap: whenever a soldier with agility lower than d_i steps on a trap (that is, moves to the point l_i), he gets instantly killed. Fortunately, you can disarm traps: if you move to the point r_i, you disarm this trap, and it no longer poses any danger to your soldiers. Traps don't affect you, only your soldiers.

You have t seconds to complete the level — that is, to bring some soldiers from your squad to the boss. Before the level starts, you choose which soldiers will be coming with you, and which soldiers won't be. After that, you have to bring all of the chosen soldiers to the boss. To do so, you may perform the following actions:

  * if your location is x, you may move to x + 1 or x - 1. This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and the location of your squad is x, you may move to x + 1 or to x - 1 with your squad in one second. You may not perform this action if it puts some soldier in danger (i. e. the point your squad is moving into contains a non-disarmed trap with d_i greater than agility of some soldier from the squad). This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and there is a trap i with r_i = x, you may disarm this trap. This action is done instantly (it consumes no time). 



Note that after each action both your coordinate and the coordinate of your squad should be integers.

You have to choose the maximum number of soldiers such that they all can be brought from the point 0 to the point n + 1 (where the boss waits) in no more than t seconds.

Input

The first line contains four integers m, n, k and t (1 ≤ m, n, k, t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n < t) — the number of soldiers, the number of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps and the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the boss, respectively.

The second line contains m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_m (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the agility of the i-th soldier.

Then k lines follow, containing the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the location of the trap, the location where the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum number of soldiers you may choose so that you may bring them all to the boss in no more than t seconds.

Example

Input


5 6 4 14
1 2 3 4 5
1 5 2
1 2 5
2 3 5
3 5 3


Output


3

Note

In the first example you may take soldiers with agility 3, 4 and 5 with you. The course of action is as follows:

  * go to 2 without your squad; 
  * disarm the trap 2; 
  * go to 3 without your squad; 
  * disartm the trap 3; 
  * go to 0 without your squad; 
  * go to 7 with your squad. 



The whole plan can be executed in 13 seconds.

assistant: Given the problem statement and the provided C code, we can analyze the performance characteristics and identify potential bottlenecks. The key is to compare the line-level hit counts for slow and fast inputs to determine where the slow input causes more activity and thus more computation time.

### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Line-Level Hit Count Analysis**:
   - The `check` function (line 33) is called more frequently with the slow input (63 times) compared to the fast input (47 times). This suggests the main inefficiency lies in this function.
   - Within the `check` function, the loop starting at line 42 and the nested loop from line 50 are hit significantly more for the slow input. The slow input hits line 42 18 times and line 50 10 times, compared to 13 and 7 times, respectively, for the fast input.
   - The line `if (Traps[i].d > x)` (line 36) is checked more frequently for the slow input, indicating that the agility threshold filter is a critical point where the slow input diverges from the fast one.

2. **Data Structures and Loops**:
   - The vector `R` (line 34) is used to track the maximum `r` for traps that exceed the current agility threshold `x`. The loop from line 35 iterates over all traps to update this vector.
   - The loop starting at line 42 iterates over all positions from 0 to `n+1`. The nested loop at line 50 extends this range to handle disarming traps, causing additional time consumption.
   - The check at line 45 and the operations in the nested loop (lines 50 to 52) appear to incur significant overhead due to repeated evaluations and updates based on trap positions.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

Based on the analysis, here are the performance characterizing invariants in natural language:

1. **Trap Overlap and Agility Thresholds**:
   - "When there are many overlapping traps whose danger levels exceed a moderate agility threshold, the program might enter a slow path due to increased iterations for checking and disarming traps."
     - This is inferred from the increased hit count on lines related to trap checks and updates.

2. **High Density of Traps**:
   - "If the number of traps or their span across the level is high, the calculation of paths becomes complex and time-consuming, especially when multiple traps cover the same range."
     - The need to sort and update the `R` vector for traps with high danger levels (line 36) suggests that overlapping and high-density traps can cause slowdowns.

3. **Frequent Path Adjustments**:
   - "If the process requires frequent adjustments of the path due to disarming traps at multiple points, especially when few soldiers have sufficient agility, the program execution time increases."
     - The nested loop on line 50 shows increased hits, indicating multiple adjustments and path recalculations.

These invariants focus on how the problem's structure (traps, soldier agility) directly impacts performance by necessitating complex pathfinding operations. These conditions offer insight into future scenarios where similar slowdowns might occur, even with different inputs, while adhering to the problem's constraints.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
You are playing a computer game, where you lead a party of m soldiers. Each soldier is characterised by his agility a_i.

The level you are trying to get through can be represented as a straight line segment from point 0 (where you and your squad is initially located) to point n + 1 (where the boss is located).

The level is filled with k traps. Each trap is represented by three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i. l_i is the location of the trap, and d_i is the danger level of the trap: whenever a soldier with agility lower than d_i steps on a trap (that is, moves to the point l_i), he gets instantly killed. Fortunately, you can disarm traps: if you move to the point r_i, you disarm this trap, and it no longer poses any danger to your soldiers. Traps don't affect you, only your soldiers.

You have t seconds to complete the level — that is, to bring some soldiers from your squad to the boss. Before the level starts, you choose which soldiers will be coming with you, and which soldiers won't be. After that, you have to bring all of the chosen soldiers to the boss. To do so, you may perform the following actions:

  * if your location is x, you may move to x + 1 or x - 1. This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and the location of your squad is x, you may move to x + 1 or to x - 1 with your squad in one second. You may not perform this action if it puts some soldier in danger (i. e. the point your squad is moving into contains a non-disarmed trap with d_i greater than agility of some soldier from the squad). This action consumes one second; 
  * if your location is x and there is a trap i with r_i = x, you may disarm this trap. This action is done instantly (it consumes no time). 



Note that after each action both your coordinate and the coordinate of your squad should be integers.

You have to choose the maximum number of soldiers such that they all can be brought from the point 0 to the point n + 1 (where the boss waits) in no more than t seconds.

Input

The first line contains four integers m, n, k and t (1 ≤ m, n, k, t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n < t) — the number of soldiers, the number of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps and the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the boss, respectively.

The second line contains m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_m (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), where a_i is the agility of the i-th soldier.

Then k lines follow, containing the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers l_i, r_i and d_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the location of the trap, the location where the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the maximum number of soldiers you may choose so that you may bring them all to the boss in no more than t seconds.

Example

Input


5 6 4 14
1 2 3 4 5
1 5 2
1 2 5
2 3 5
3 5 3


Output


3

Note

In the first example you may take soldiers with agility 3, 4 and 5 with you. The course of action is as follows:

  * go to 2 without your squad; 
  * disarm the trap 2; 
  * go to 3 without your squad; 
  * disartm the trap 3; 
  * go to 0 without your squad; 
  * go to 7 with your squad. 



The whole plan can be executed in 13 seconds.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Performance-Characterizing Invariants in C++

For each natural language invariant derived in Phase 2, here is the checker code implemented in C++:

#### Invariant #1: Trap Overlap and Agility Thresholds
- **Natural Language Description**: When there are many overlapping traps whose danger levels exceed a moderate agility threshold, the program might enter a slow path due to increased iterations for checking and disarming traps.

```cpp
void check_trap_overlap_invariant(const vector<trap>& Traps, int x) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& tr : Traps) {
        if (tr.d > x) {
            count++;
            if (count > 100) { // Assuming 100 as a reasonable threshold for this scenario
                cerr << "Warning: trap_overlap_invariant triggered - too many overlapping traps with high danger level" << endl;
                abort();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #2: High Density of Traps
- **Natural Language Description**: If the number of traps or their span across the level is high, the calculation of paths becomes complex and time-consuming, especially when multiple traps cover the same range.

```cpp
void check_high_density_traps(const vector<trap>& Traps, int n) {
    int covered_ranges = 0;
    vector<int> coverage(n + 2, 0);
    for (const auto& tr : Traps) {
        for (int i = tr.l; i <= tr.r; ++i) {
            coverage[i]++;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (coverage[i] > 10) { // Assuming a coverage threshold of 10
            cerr << "Warning: high_density_traps invariant triggered - high trap coverage at position " << i << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Invariant #3: Frequent Path Adjustments
- **Natural Language Description**: If the process requires frequent adjustments of the path due to disarming traps at multiple points, especially when few soldiers have sufficient agility, the program execution time increases.

```cpp
void check_frequent_path_adjustments(int num_adjustments) {
    if (num_adjustments > 20) { // Assuming 20 as a threshold for frequent adjustments
        cerr << "Warning: frequent_path_adjustments invariant triggered - excessive path recalculations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checks into the Original C++ Program

Now, I will integrate these checks into the provided C++ code at strategic points to detect potential performance bottlenecks:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

struct trap {
    int l, r, d;
    trap() {}
    trap(int a, int b, int c) {
        l = a; r = b; d = c;
    }
};

// Checkers for performance-characterizing invariants

void check_trap_overlap_invariant(const vector<trap>& Traps, int x) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& tr : Traps) {
        if (tr.d > x) {
            count++;
            if (count > 100) {
                cerr << "Warning: trap_overlap_invariant triggered - too many overlapping traps with high danger level" << endl;
                abort();
            }
        }
    }
}

void check_high_density_traps(const vector<trap>& Traps, int n) {
    vector<int> coverage(n + 2, 0);
    for (const auto& tr : Traps) {
        for (int i = tr.l; i <= tr.r; ++i) {
            coverage[i]++;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (coverage[i] > 10) {
            cerr << "Warning: high_density_traps invariant triggered - high trap coverage at position " << i << endl;
            abort();
        }
    }
}

void check_frequent_path_adjustments(int num_adjustments) {
    if (num_adjustments > 20) {
        cerr << "Warning: frequent_path_adjustments invariant triggered - excessive path recalculations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

void solve() {
    int m, n, k, t;
    cin >> m >> n >> k >> t;
    vector<int> agility(m);
    vector<trap> Traps(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        cin >> agility[i];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int l, r, d;
        cin >> l >> r >> d;
        Traps[i] = trap(l, r, d);
    }
    
    sort(agility.begin(), agility.end());

    const int N = 2e5 + 10;
    auto check = [&Traps, &k, &t, &n](int x) -> bool {
        vector<int> R(N, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            if (Traps[i].d > x) {
                R[Traps[i].l] = max(R[Traps[i].l], Traps[i].r);
            }
        }

        ll total = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int num_adjustments = 0; // Track adjustments
        while (i < n + 1) {
            int j = i;
            int target = R[j];
            if (target == -1) {
                i++;
                total++;
                continue;
            }
            while (j < target) {
                j++;
                target = max(target, R[j]);
                num_adjustments++; // Increment on each path adjustment
            }
            total += 1LL * (j - i + 1) * 2 + (j - i);
            if (i == j) {
                i++;
                total++;
                continue;
            }
            i = j;
        }
        
        // Check for frequent path adjustments
        check_frequent_path_adjustments(num_adjustments);
        
        return total <= (ll)t;
    };

    // Check high density traps before binary search
    check_high_density_traps(Traps, n);

    int ans = 0;
    int left = 0;
    int right = m - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        // Check trap overlap invariant during binary search
        check_trap_overlap_invariant(Traps, agility[mid]);
        
        if (check(agility[mid])) {
            ans = m - 1 - mid + 1;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    solve();
}
```

### Explanation

- **Trap Overlap Check**: Integrated within the binary search inside the `solve` function to detect potential issues with overlapping traps for each agility threshold considered.
- **High Density Traps Check**: Executed once before the binary search starts, to ensure the initial conditions regarding trap density are not problematic.
- **Frequent Path Adjustments Check**: Incorporated within the `check` function to assess how many times path recalculations might occur during the evaluation of each potential agility threshold.

This integration enables the program to detect runtime scenarios that could lead to performance bottlenecks, ensuring that developers are alerted to potential issues early. The checks have been positioned to minimize additional overhead while covering critical performance scenarios.
