system: You are a helpful assistant good at coding.

user: (A) Context

You are an experienced C software engineer focusing on performance bottlenecks. You have:
1. A problem statement describing a task or algorithm (with constraints such as n <= 100).
2. A C program that implements a solution to that problem.
3. Two inputs: a “fast” input that completes quickly, and a “slow” input that takes much longer—both inputs have similar size/structure.
4. Line-level hit counts for both runs, showing which lines get hit significantly more often on the slow input.

Your goal is to diagnose why the program runs slowly for the slow input and derive conditions or invariants that capture what triggers this slowdown.

(B) Tasks: Analyze the given code and generate performance-characterizing invariants in natural language

Phase 1: Identify expensive or onefficient code segments. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Compare line-level hit counts between the fast and slow runs.
2. Pinpoint lines or functions that get significantly more hits under the slow input.
3. Infer how these lines might be interacting with data structures, loops, recursion, etc., especially as they relate to the input constraints (e.g., n <= 100).

Phase 2: Derive performance-characterizing invariants (natural language). In this phase you are asked to,
1. Generate natural language statements that describe conditions under which the program likely enters a slow path.
2. Avoid using specific numeric values from the slow input; abstract them into categories or thresholds. However, make sure those thresholds adhere to the input constraints of the problem.
3. Correlate these conditions strongly to input patterns (e.g., “when n is close to 100 and there is a nested loop,” or “when a data structure is repeatedly sorted”).
4. Ensure your statements are broad enough to catch possible future slow scenarios, but still reflect realistic triggers given the constraints (like n <= 100).

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

Example Invariant #1:

A potential slowdown arises when certain arrays or lists grow large, causing repeated operations. One way to detect this is to check if the size of a critical array arr (used in a nested loop) exceeds a broad threshold.

Natural language description: “If arr is very large and used in nested loops, the code may repeat operations too many times.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
// Sample checker function
void check_size_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

Code implementing the natural language description:

```cpp
void check_sort_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: sort_invariant triggered - repeatedly sorting large data" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

```cpp
void check_dfs_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

Example invariant #5:

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

Natural langauge description: "If function foo is an expensive function to execute, and is called a large number of times in a loop or recursive function, the program may slow down significantly"

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```

(C) Output Requirements
1. Provide a list of natural language performance invariants explaining under what conditions the code slows down.
2. Do not mention or rely on exact values from the provided slow input.
3. Use or suggest threshold values that align with problem constraints (e.g., n <= 100).
4. The output should be a concise, descriptive set of statements about performance triggers.

(D) Important Considerations
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. Avoid checks inside tight loops. Place checks in a way that does not significantly degrade performance.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

(E) Problem Statement

The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Polycarp has to write a coursework. The coursework consists of m pages.

Polycarp also has n cups of coffee. The coffee in the i-th cup has a_i caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).

Surely, courseworks are not usually being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least). Some of them require multiple days of hard work.

Let's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks k cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ..., a_{i_k}. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write a_{i_1} pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write max(0, a_{i_2} - 1) pages, the third cup gives him energy to write max(0, a_{i_3} - 2) pages, ..., the k-th cup gives him energy to write max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1) pages.

If Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.

Polycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4) — the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), where a_i is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the i-th cup.

Output

If it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of days Polycarp needs to do it.

Note

In the first example Polycarp can drink fourth cup during first day (and write 1 page), first and second cups during second day (and write 2 + (3 - 1) = 4 pages), fifth cup during the third day (and write 2 pages) and third cup during the fourth day (and write 1 page) so the answer is 4. It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days in this test.

In the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write 4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6 pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write 4 pages) so the answer is 2. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.

In the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write 5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15 pages of coursework.

In the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write 5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14 pages of coursework and during second day he will write 5 pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.

In the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.

assistant: ### Phase 1: Identify Expensive or Inefficient Code Segments

1. **Comparison of Line-Level Hit Counts**:
   - The `check` function (lines 6-12) and its loop (lines 8-10) are executed significantly more times for the slow input compared to the fast input. Specifically, line 8 is hit 707 times, while lines 9 and 10 are hit 700 times each. This suggests the loop runs for many iterations.
   - In contrast, for the fast input, the `check` function does not execute at all, implying the binary search (lines 30-38) completes quickly, possibly due to an early termination condition being met.

2. **Pinpointing the Cause**:
   - The binary search in the `main` function utilizes the `check` function to determine the minimum number of days required. The slow input results in many more iterations of this binary search, invoking the `check` function multiple times.
   - Within the `check` function, the loop iterating over the coffee cups (line 8) is particularly expensive. This loop calculates the number of pages written with a given number of days, decrementing the pages count based on the sequence of cups (variable `k`).

3. **Interaction with Data Structures**:
   - The primary data structure is the sorted vector `v`, where elements are accessed in sequence to determine their contribution to writing pages.
   - The main observed inefficiency arises from how the binary search upper-bound (`high`) influences the number of iterations through `check`, and the cumulative effect of decrement operations in the loop.

### Phase 2: Derive Performance-Characterizing Invariants

1. **Invariant Conditions**:
   - **High Number of Inefficient Iterations**: If the binary search algorithm requires many iterations to find the minimum number of days, it will repeatedly call the `check` function, making the computation costly if the search space is not rapidly reduced.

2. **Natural Language Statements**:
   - **Binary Search Complexity**: "When the necessary pages `m` are close to the cumulative caffeine sum of all cups `n`, the binary search becomes extended, causing the `check` function to be called numerous times, each with a complete iteration over all cups. This is especially expensive when `n` is high."
   - **Cup Order and Decrement Complexity**: "If the caffeine values must be used in a decremental sequence with many non-zero decrements (due to `k` values increasing), the repeated decrement operations over large sequences can cause a slowdown."

3. **Correlated Input Patterns**:
   - **Close Capacity and Requirement**: "When the total caffeine capacity is near the coursework page requirement `m`, the solution space requires extensive searching, causing more hits on the loop inside `check`."
   - **Large Number of Cups (`n` close to 100)**: "When the number of cups `n` approaches its maximum limit, the nested iterations within the `check` function amplify, further extending execution time."

These invariants characterize the types of input and algorithmic conditions leading to the slow execution paths in the program, providing a basis for detecting potential performance bottlenecks.

user: (A) Context

You have already:
1. Identified expensive code segments (Phase 1).
2. Derived performance-characterizing invariants in natural language (Phase 2).

Now, you MUST transform these invariants into runtime checks and integrate them into the given C++ program.

(B) Tasks: Revisit the performance-characteristic invariants you inferred in natural langauge and write faithful, error-free C++ code snippets to implement them

You MUST do perform this task in two phases and provide separate answers for both: First, translating the invariants into checker code in C++ (phase 3, below). Second, integrating those checker C++ code snippets with the original program for which you inferred those invariants (phase 4, below).   

Phase 3: Implement the natural language invariants inferred previously, in C++. In this phase you are asked to, 
1. For each natural language invariant from Phase 2, you MUST produce C++ code that checks the condition at runtime.
2. You MUST NOT relax or trivialize the checker code implementing these performance-characterizing invariants. You MUST faithfully implement them as described. 
3. Use the following template for writing checker code in C++ which could also be implemented as a helper function:
```cpp
    if (/* condition based on the NL invariant */) {
        cerr << "Warning: Performance bottleneck condition triggered!" << endl;
        abort();
    }
``` 

Note that not all performance-characterizing invariants are about maximising input size. You may refer to the following examples for inspiration --- some maximising the input size, some not --- but do not simply replicate them exactly. Rather, use them as inspiration to infer and tailor performance-characterizing invariants tailored for the C++ code and problem statement you were asked to analize:

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: size_invariant triggered - array too large for nested loops" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Usage in main or function
int arrSize = arr.size();
check_size_invariant(arrSize > 50000);
```

Example Invariant #2:

Repeated sorting or searching on a data structure can degrade performance, especially if the data structure is large or if the sorting is called multiple times in a loop.

Natural language description: “If a large portion of the code’s execution time is spent in sorting a data structure repeatedly, performance may degrade. Check if the data structure is frequently resorted or reprocessed when it has many elements.”

    }
}

// After reading input or before sorting
int elementCount = someDataStructure.size();
check_sort_invariant(elementCount > 100000 && /* some condition indicating repeated sorts */);
```

Example Invariant #3:

Recursion (e.g., graph traversal or the iterative version of it, recurssive dynamic programming, recurssive computation like computing the next Fibonacci number, etc.) can become expensive if it explores a large search space. A sign of this might be a high branching factor combined with a deep recursion depth.

Natural language description: “If the recursion depth is likely to exceed a certain level or if many branches are processed at each recursive call, the computation may become very expensive.”

    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: dfs_invariant triggered - high recursion depth or branching factor" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Before calling dfs or inside setup
check_dfs_invariant((maxDepthEstimate > 50) && (branchFactorEstimate > 10));
```

Example Invariant #4:

Memory usage spikes or large matrix operations can slow down computation if array dimensions become too large. If the program initializes a 2D array based on input dimensions n and m, certain input combinations can trigger large memory footprints or nested loops over the entire matrix.

Natural language description: “If n and m together exceed a threshold that implies large matrix computations, the program may slow significantly.”

```cpp
void check_matrix_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: matrix_invariant triggered - potentially large matrix operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// After reading n, m
check_matrix_invariant(n * m > 1000000);
```

If a program runs an expensive function or heavy-weight code (e.g. memory allocation) repeatedly within a performance-critical loop or function, the overhead for calling that function can accumulate, slowing the program significantly.

```cpp
void check_expensive_function_invariant(bool condition) {
    if (condition) {
        cerr << "Warning: expensive function invariant triggered - excessive calls" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

check_expensive_function_invariant(n > 1000000);  // arbitrary, but large threshold
for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
    foo(); // expensive function
}
```


Phase 4: Propagate and insert conditional checks. In this phase you are asked to,
1. Place each check at an effective point in the control/data flow (e.g., after reading inputs, before heavy loops) so you do not add overhead in tight loops. Note that the checker code could also be implemented as a helper function.
2. If multiple checks overlap, merge or adjust them carefully to avoid redundant warnings.
3. Provide the final, instrumented C++ code in code fences. Ensure it compiles cleanly and runs without errors.
4. For each inserted check, add a short comment explaining which bottleneck it detects.

Note the following important considerations when translating the inferred performance-characterizing invariants into code and propagating the checkers to the most efective program point by instrumenting the original code: 
1. Avoid hardcoding. Don’t rely solely on the exact values from the provided slow input; think in terms of categories or thresholds that lead to slow execution.
2. In addition to the warning message, remember to insert an "abort()" statement at the end of the checker.
3. Focus on fuzzer utility. The checks should help a fuzzer detect slow performance triggers by hitting these conditions.

As a refresher, below you are provided with the same program statement and C++ code for which you already inferred performance-characterizing invariants:

Problem statement:
The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraints.

Polycarp has to write a coursework. The coursework consists of m pages.

Polycarp also has n cups of coffee. The coffee in the i-th cup has a_i caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).

Surely, courseworks are not usually being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least). Some of them require multiple days of hard work.

Let's consider some day of Polycarp's work. Consider Polycarp drinks k cups of coffee during this day and caffeine dosages of cups Polycarp drink during this day are a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ..., a_{i_k}. Then the first cup he drinks gives him energy to write a_{i_1} pages of coursework, the second cup gives him energy to write max(0, a_{i_2} - 1) pages, the third cup gives him energy to write max(0, a_{i_3} - 2) pages, ..., the k-th cup gives him energy to write max(0, a_{i_k} - k + 1) pages.

If Polycarp doesn't drink coffee during some day, he cannot write coursework at all that day.

Polycarp has to finish his coursework as soon as possible (spend the minimum number of days to do it). Your task is to find out this number of days or say that it is impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4) — the number of cups of coffee and the number of pages in the coursework.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), where a_i is the caffeine dosage of coffee in the i-th cup.

Output

If it is impossible to write the coursework, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of days Polycarp needs to do it.

Note

In the first example Polycarp can drink fourth cup during first day (and write 1 page), first and second cups during second day (and write 2 + (3 - 1) = 4 pages), fifth cup during the third day (and write 2 pages) and third cup during the fourth day (and write 1 page) so the answer is 4. It is obvious that there is no way to write the coursework in three or less days in this test.

In the second example Polycarp can drink third, fourth and second cups during first day (and write 4 + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 6 pages) and sixth cup during second day (and write 4 pages) so the answer is 2. It is obvious that Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework in one day in this test.

In the third example Polycarp can drink all cups of coffee during first day and write 5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 15 pages of coursework.

In the fourth example Polycarp cannot drink all cups during first day and should drink one of them during the second day. So during first day he will write 5 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 2) + (5 - 3) = 14 pages of coursework and during second day he will write 5 pages of coursework. This is enough to complete it.

In the fifth example Polycarp cannot write the whole coursework at all, even if he will drink one cup of coffee during each day, so the answer is -1.

assistant: ### Phase 3: Implementing Invariants as C++ Checkers

1. **Binary Search Complexity** Invariant:
   - **Description**: "When the necessary pages `m` are close to the cumulative caffeine sum of all cups `n`, the binary search becomes extended, causing the `check` function to be called numerous times, each with a complete iteration over all cups."
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_binary_search_invariant(long long sum, long long m, int search_iterations) {
         if (search_iterations > 100 && sum >= m && (m > 0.9 * sum)) {
             cerr << "Warning: binary_search_invariant triggered - extended binary search due to close capacity and requirement" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Cup Order and Decrement Complexity** Invariant:
   - **Description**: "If the caffeine values must be used in a decremental sequence with many non-zero decrements, the repeated decrement operations over large sequences can cause a slowdown."
   - **Checker Code**:
     ```cpp
     void check_cup_order_invariant(const vector<long long>& v, long long m) {
         long long potential_pages = 0;
         int decrement_operations = 0;
         for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
             potential_pages += max(0ll, v[i] - (long long)i);
             if (v[i] > (long long)i) {
                 ++decrement_operations;
             }
         }
         if (decrement_operations > 50 && potential_pages < m) {
             cerr << "Warning: cup_order_invariant triggered - extensive decrement operations" << endl;
             abort();
         }
     }
     ```

### Phase 4: Integrating Checkers into the Program

Now, we will integrate these checker functions into the original C++ solution code. We will place these checks after reading inputs, before the binary search and just after sorting, to avoid placing them inside tight loops.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const long long int N = 1e6;
long long int n, m;

// Checker for binary search complexity
void check_binary_search_invariant(long long sum, long long m, int search_iterations) {
    if (search_iterations > 100 && sum >= m && (m > 0.9 * sum)) {
        cerr << "Warning: binary_search_invariant triggered - extended binary search due to close capacity and requirement" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

// Checker for cup order and decrement complexity
void check_cup_order_invariant(const vector<long long>& v, long long m) {
    long long potential_pages = 0;
    int decrement_operations = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
        potential_pages += max(0ll, v[i] - (long long)i);
        if (v[i] > (long long)i) {
            ++decrement_operations;
        }
    }
    if (decrement_operations > 50 && potential_pages < m) {
        cerr << "Warning: cup_order_invariant triggered - extensive decrement operations" << endl;
        abort();
    }
}

bool check(long long int days) {
    long long int pages = 0, k = 0;
    for (long long int i = 0, j = 0; j < n; i++, j++) {
        pages += max(0ll, v[j] - k);
        if (i + 1 == days) i = -1, k++;
    }
    return pages >= m;
}

int32_t main() {
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    scanf("%lld", &m);
    long long int sum = 0;
    vector<long long int> v(N);
    for (long long int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scanf("%lld", &v[i]);
        sum += v[i];
    }
    
    // Check invariants after reading inputs
    check_cup_order_invariant(v, m);

    if (sum < m) {
        printf("-1");
        return 0;
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<long long int>());

    long long int ans = 1e16;
    long long int low = 1;
    long long int high = n;
    int search_iterations = 0; // Counter for binary search iterations
    while (low <= high) {
        ++search_iterations;
        long long int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (check(mid)) {
            ans = min(ans, mid);
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Check binary search invariant after the search
    check_binary_search_invariant(sum, m, search_iterations);

    printf("%lld", ans);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Checker Functions**: We have defined two checker functions that encapsulate the invariants we derived. These are checked at strategic points in the program flow.
- **Integration and Comments**: The `check_cup_order_invariant` is called after input reading and sorting to ensure it doesn't interfere with the tight loops inside the `check` function. The `check_binary_search_invariant` is called after the binary search operation to evaluate its scope.
- **Avoiding Overheads**: The checks are placed outside of critical loops to minimize performance impact during normal operation.
