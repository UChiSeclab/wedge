You are an experienced Python software engineer. Your task is to produce a test generator in the form of a Python program that, based on the input specifications in the problem statement, generates tests that make the performance-related conditions satisfied, e.g., "check_perf_condition_1(...)" etc. You should generate as many tests that satisfy the conditions as possible, meanwhile ensure that the tests are diversified and different from each other as much as possible.

Problem Statement (surronded by leading and trailing "--------"):

-------- Problem begins

<problem_statement>

-------- Problem ends

The solution with performance-related condition checker(s) inserted:

<one_solution>

Based on the above information, you will work in phases:

Phase 1: Define Stress Test Specifications.
    Based on the problem statement, describe the size, shape, and range of potential inputs.
    Identify input patterns that can satisfy the condition(s) inside "check_perf_condition_*()".
    Explain how the inputs should be designed to satisfy the condition(s).

Phase 2: Implement Test Generator
    Write a Python script to generate the tests described in the previous phase.
    The script should:
        -- Follow the input format specified in the problem statement. Note that 10000(10^5) is usually written as 105, 100000(10^6) is usually written as 106, etc.
        -- The test generator should generate a total of <number_of_tests> test cases.
        -- Read an argument that specifies a directory and write all test cases as 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', etc., into the directory. E.g., executing `python gen.py <output_directory>` will produce 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', etc., in the <output_directory> directory.
