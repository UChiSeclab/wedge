You are an experienced Python software engineer. Your task is to produce a test generator in the form of a Python program that, based on the input specifications in the problem statement, generates tests that exhaust the solutions of the problem more.

Problem Statement (surronded by leading and trailing "--------"):

-------- Problem begins

<problem_statement>

-------- Problem ends


Based on the above information, you will work in phases:

Phase 1: Define Stress Test Specifications.
    Based on the problem statement, describe the size, shape, and range of potential inputs.
    Identify input patterns that can maximize the inefficiencies of the "slow" programs.
    Don't just limit the generator into generating tests that maximize input size, but suggest specific values or patterns for inputs that can stress the slow programs (e.g., sorted arrays, repeated elements, specific edge cases).
    Explain how the inputs should be designed to exploit algorithmic inefficiencies or implementation anti-patterns.

Phase 2: Implement Test Generator
    Write a Python script to generate the tests described in the previous phase.
    The script should:
        -- Follow the input format specified in the problem statement. Note that 10000(10^5) is usually written as 105, 100000(10^6) is usually written as 106, etc.
        -- Maximize stress on the programs to make those inefficient programs get TLE or MLE.
        -- Avoid using random generator with a large range of values when generating the size input (e.g., length of array, etc.), e.g., random.randint(1, 10000) (say 10000 is the upper bound), as it may not stress the program enough. Instead, use values that are more likely to cause inefficiencies, for example, values closer to the upper bound, like 10000, 9999, 9990 or random.randint(9900, 10000), etc. But for numbers that are not the size of the input, you may want to generate random values to improve the input diversity and cover different patterns.
        -- The test generator should generate a total of <number_of_tests> test cases.
        -- Read an argument that specifies a directory and write all test cases as 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', etc., into the directory. E.g., executing `python gen.py <output_directory>` will produce 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', etc., in the <output_directory> directory.
