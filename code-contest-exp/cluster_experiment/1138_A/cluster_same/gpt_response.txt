Creating a Python script that generates exhaustive test cases to check for Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) on provided Java solutions involves creating input instances that meet the upper limits and edge cases specified in the problem statement. Given the problem constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), we need to generate large test cases.

Below is a Python script that generates these test cases and writes them to specified files in a given directory.

```python
import os
import sys
import random

def generate_test_cases(directory):
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)
   
    max_n = 100000

    # Test case 1: Maximum size, alternating pattern
    n = max_n
    sequence = [1, 2] * (n // 2)
    if len(sequence) < n:  # if n is odd
        sequence.append(1)
    write_test_case(directory, 1, n, sequence)

    # Test case 2: Maximum size, all 1s then all 2s
    sequence = [1] * (n // 2) + [2] * (n // 2)
    write_test_case(directory, 2, n, sequence)

    # Test case 3: Maximum size, all 2s then all 1s
    sequence = [2] * (n // 3) + [1] * (n - n // 3)
    write_test_case(directory, 3, n, sequence)

    # Test case 4: Maximum size, random 1s and 2s
    sequence = [random.choice([1, 2]) for _ in range(n)]
    write_test_case(directory, 4, n, sequence)

    # Test case 5: Minimum size, alternating starting with 1
    n = 2
    sequence = [1, 2]
    write_test_case(directory, 5, n, sequence)

    # Test case 6: Edge case size, long continuous segments
    n = max_n
    sequence = ([1] * 49999 + [2] * 50001)
    write_test_case(directory, 6, n, sequence)

    print(f"Generated test cases in directory: {directory}")

def write_test_case(directory, test_case_id, n, sequence):
    file_name = f"test_{test_case_id:02}.in"
    file_path = os.path.join(directory, file_name)
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{n}\n")
        f.write(" ".join(map(str, sequence)) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python generate_test_cases.py <directory>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    directory = sys.argv[1]
    generate_test_cases(directory)
```

### Explanation:
1. **generate_test_cases**: This function generates several test cases.
   - **Test Case 1**: Alternates 1, 2 for the maximum size.
   - **Test Case 2**: Continuous segment of 1s followed by 2s.
   - **Test Case 3**: Continuous segment of 2s followed by 1s.
   - **Test Case 4**: Random 1s and 2s for the maximum size.
   - **Test Case 5**: Edge case with the minimum input size.
   - **Test Case 6**: Large continuous segments of 1s then 2s.
 
2. **write_test_case**: This function writes the generated test case to a file with a standardized name.

### Usage:
Execute this script from the command line, providing the directory as an argument where the test cases should be saved. For example:
```
python generate_test_cases.py /path/to/testcases
```

This will create multiple test files named `test_01.in`, `test_02.in`, ..., in the specified directory, each containing different test scenarios aimed at stressing the code for performance issues.
