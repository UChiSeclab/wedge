To generate test cases for the given problem that exhaust the code to potentially get a time limit exceeded (TLE), we need to focus on creating test cases with maximum length inputs. Here, the string `commands` should have a length of 100, and the number of changes \( n \) should be 50.

The following Python script will generate such test cases and write them into the specified directory as 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', and so on.

```python
import os
import sys
import random

# Ensure the user passes the output directory as an argument.
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python generate_test_cases.py <output_directory>")
    sys.exit(1)

output_directory = sys.argv[1]

# Create the directory if it does not exist
if not os.path.exists(output_directory):
    os.makedirs(output_directory)

def generate_test_case(test_case_number):
    filename = f"test_{test_case_number:02d}.in"
    filepath = os.path.join(output_directory, filename)

    # Generate a command string of 100 characters (randomly 'T' or 'F')
    commands = ''.join(random.choice(['T', 'F']) for _ in range(100))
    # The number of changes (n) should be 50 in our maximum scenario
    n = 50

    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{commands}\n")
        f.write(f"{n}\n")

# Generate a number of test cases, e.g., 10 test cases
for i in range(1, 11):
    generate_test_case(i)

print(f"Test cases generated in directory: {output_directory}")
```

### How to use the script:

1. **Save the code as `generate_test_cases.py`.**
2. **Run the script from the command line with the desired output directory:**

   ```bash
   python generate_test_cases.py /path/to/output_directory
   ```

### Explanation:

- **Output Directory**: The script requires an output directory where all test cases will be stored.
- **Generating Test Cases**: The script generates 10 test cases (you can change the number by modifying the loop range).
- **Command String**: A string of 100 characters (`commands`) where each character is randomly chosen between 'T' and 'F'.
- **Number of Changes (n)**: Set to 50 which is the maximum value from the constraints.
- **Writing Files**: Each test case is written to a separate file in the specified directory, named `test_01.in`, `test_02.in`, ..., `test_10.in`.

This script ensures that the generated test cases can potentially reach the maximum execution time by maximizing the input size, thereby exhausting the solution code.
