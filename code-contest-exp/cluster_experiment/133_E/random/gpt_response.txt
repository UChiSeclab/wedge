To create a Python script that generates test cases for the provided programming problem and writes these cases into a specified directory, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Problem and Input Details:**
   Given the problem statement, our inputs are a string of commands ("T" and "F") and an integer \( n \) which represents the number of changes to be made to the commands.

2. **Understand the Requirements for Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) Test Cases:**
   To generate test cases that push the solution towards a time limit exceeded (TLE), we'll need to create the largest possible inputs as per the constraints. For this problem:
   - The command string should have the maximum length, which is 100.
   - The number of changes should be the maximum possible value, which is 50.

3. **Create the Test Cases:**
   We'll generate a variety of test cases ensuring:
   - The command string contains a mix of "T" and "F".
   - The number of changes \( n \) is set to 50 (the maximum limit).

4. **Write to Files:**
   We'll write each test case to a new file in the specified directory, naming them sequentially.

Here's the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import os
import random

def generate_test_cases(directory, num_cases=10):
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)
    
    # Maximum constraints to create TLE prone test cases
    max_length = 100
    max_changes = 50
    
    for i in range(num_cases):
        # Generate a random sequence of commands of length 100
        commands = ''.join(random.choice(['T', 'F']) for _ in range(max_length))
        n = max_changes  # Always set changes to 50
        
        # Create the filename
        filename = os.path.join(directory, f"test_{i+1:02d}.in")
        
        # Write the test case to the file
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write(f"{commands}\n")
            f.write(f"{n}\n")
    
    print(f"Generated {num_cases} test cases in directory: {directory}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python generate_test_cases.py <directory>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Directory to save the test cases
    output_directory = sys.argv[1]
    
    # Generate the test cases
    generate_test_cases(output_directory)
```

### How to Run the Script:

1. Save the script as `generate_test_cases.py`.
2. Run the script using a command line or terminal:
   ```bash
   python generate_test_cases.py <directory>
   ```
   Replace `<directory>` with the path to the desired directory where you want to save the test cases.

### Example Usage:
```bash
python generate_test_cases.py testcases
```

This will generate .in files named `test_01.in`, `test_02.in`, ..., `test_10.in` in the `testcases` directory, each containing a random command string of length 100 followed by the number 50 on the next line. Each test case adheres to the problem's constraints and is crafted to potentially induce a TLE in sub-optimal solutions.
