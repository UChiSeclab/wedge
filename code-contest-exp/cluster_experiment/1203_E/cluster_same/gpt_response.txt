Certainly! Here is a Python script that generates test cases for the provided problem. The test cases are focused on exhausting the code to potentially cause a time limit exceeded (TLE) error:

```python
import os
import random

def generate_test_cases(directory, num_cases=10):
    os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)
    
    max_n = 150000
    max_weight = 150000
    
    for i in range(1, num_cases + 1):
        filename = os.path.join(directory, f'test_{i:02d}.in')
        
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            n = random.randint(max_n // 2, max_n)
            weights = [random.randint(1, max_weight) for _ in range(n)]
            
            # Writing to the file
            f.write(f"{n}\n")
            f.write(' '.join(map(str, weights)) + '\n')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python generate_test_cases.py <directory>")
    else:
        directory = sys.argv[1]
        generate_test_cases(directory)
```

### Usage
Save the script to a file named `generate_test_cases.py`. You can then run the script from the command line, specifying the directory where the test cases should be written. For example:

```bash
python generate_test_cases.py test_cases_directory
```

### Explanation
1. **Imports and Directory Setup:** The script starts by importing the necessary modules (`os` and `random`). It ensures the specified directory exists by creating it if it does not.
2. **Test Case Generation Loop:** It loops through `num_cases` times (default 10). For each test case:
    - A file is created with an appropriate name (e.g., `test_01.in`, `test_02.in`, etc.).
    - The number of boxers `n` is randomly selected to be between half of the maximum value and the max value (`150000`).
    - Their weights are also randomly chosen between 1 and the max weight (`150000`).
3. **Writing Test Cases:** The generated values are written to the respective input file in the required format. Each file contains one test case.

Feel free to adjust the `num_cases` or the range for `n` and weights as per your needs.
