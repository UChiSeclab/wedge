Certainly! Below is a Python script that generates test cases for the given problem with a focus on exhausting the code to the point it could get a time limit exceeded (TLE). The script reads an argument specifying a directory and writes the test cases into that directory as 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', etc.

```python
import os
import random
import sys

def generate_test_cases(directory, num_cases=10, n_max=150000, weight_range=(1, 150000)):
    """
    This function generates test cases for a specific problem.
    Args:
    - directory: str, the directory where test cases should be saved.
    - num_cases: int, the number of test cases to generate.
    - n_max: int, the maximum value of n (number of boxers).
    - weight_range: tuple(int, int), the range of weights for the boxers.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)

    for i in range(num_cases):
        file_name = f"test_{i+1:02d}.in"
        file_path = os.path.join(directory, file_name)

        # Generating a large number of boxers
        n = n_max

        if i < num_cases - 1:
            weights = [random.randint(weight_range[0], weight_range[1]) for _ in range(n)]
        else:
            # Ensuring the last test case has many consecutive weights to maximize processing time
            weights = [weight_range[0] + (x % (weight_range[1] - weight_range[0] + 1)) for x in range(n)]

        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(f"{n}\n")
            f.write(" ".join(map(str, weights)) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python generate_test_cases.py <directory>")
        sys.exit(1)

    output_directory = sys.argv[1]
    generate_test_cases(output_directory)
```

### Explanation
1. **Argument Handling**: The script expects the path to the directory where the test cases should be saved. It reads this from the command line arguments.
2. **Directory Creation**: If the specified directory does not exist, it creates it.
3. **Test Case Generation**:
    - It generates a specified number of test cases (`num_cases`), in this case, 10 by default.
    - For most test cases, it generates random weights within a given range.
    - For the last test case, it generates weights with many consecutive values to ensure the code is tested for a potential TLE scenario.
4. **File Writing**: Each test case is saved in a file named 'test_01.in', 'test_02.in', etc., within the specified directory.

### How to Use
1. Save the above script as `generate_test_cases.py`.
2. Run the script from the command line and provide the target directory as an argument:
   ```sh
   python generate_test_cases.py ./test_cases
   ```
   This will generate the test cases in the `./test_cases` directory.
