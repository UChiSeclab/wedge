Certainly! Here’s an example Python script that can be used to generate test cases for the provided problem statement, specifically aiming to exhaust the code to get a time limit exceeded (TLE) response. The script will create large test cases within the constraints of the problem to stress test the solutions.

```python
import os
import sys
import random

def generate_case(n, filename):
    """
    Generate a single test case and write to a file.
    """
    weights = [random.randint(1, 150000) for _ in range(n)]
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{n}\n")
        f.write(" ".join(map(str, weights)) + "\n")

def generate_cases(directory, num_cases, sizes):
    """
    Generate multiple test cases and write them to the specified directory.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)

    for i in range(1, num_cases + 1):
        filename = os.path.join(directory, f'test_{i:02d}.in')
        size = sizes[i % len(sizes)]
        generate_case(size, filename)
        print(f"Test case {i} with size {size} written to {filename}")

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python generate_testcases.py <directory>")
        return

    directory = sys.argv[1]
    
    num_cases = 10  # Number of test cases to generate
    sizes = [150000] * num_cases  # List of sizes for each test case, making them maximum

    generate_cases(directory, num_cases, sizes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### How to Use the Script

1. **Save the Script**: Save the script as `generate_testcases.py`.

2. **Run the Script**: Run the script from the command line providing the directory where you want to save the generated test cases.
   ```sh
   python generate_testcases.py /path/to/directory
   ```

3. **Directory Argument**: Make sure to replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where you want the test case files to be saved.

### Understanding the Script

- **generate_case**: This function generates a test case with `n` boxers, each with a random weight between 1 and 150000.
  
- **generate_cases**: This function generates multiple test cases and saves them as files in the specified directory. It calls `generate_case` for each test case.

- **main**: The entry point of the script. It checks the command-line arguments, sets the number of cases and their sizes, and calls `generate_cases` to generate and save the test cases.

### Customizing the Script

- **Number of Cases**: Adjust `num_cases` if you need more or fewer test cases.
- **Sizes**: Currently, all test cases are created with the maximum size (150000). If you want a mix of different sizes, modify `sizes` accordingly. For example:
  ```python
  sizes = [150000, 100000, 50000, 25000, 12500]
  ```

This script can help you generate random test cases that are particularly large to stress test the provided solutions. Ensure that the directory you are writing to has write permissions.
