To generate extensive test cases for the given problem, we need to focus on creating large trees and querying pairs of vertices in such a way that the algorithms will be extensively stressed. The following script will do exactly that, creating binary tree structures and different query scenarios. 

Below is the Python script that generates test cases:

```python
import os
import random

MODULO = 10**9 + 7

def generate_test_case(n, q):
    # Create a balanced binary tree
    edges = []
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        edges.append((i // 2, i, random.randint(1, MODULO)))

    queries = []
    for _ in range(q):
        u = random.randint(1, n)
        v = random.randint(1, n)
        queries.append((u, v))
    
    return edges, queries

def write_test_case(filepath, n, edges, q, queries):
    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"{n}\n")
        for a, b, c in edges:
            f.write(f"{a} {b} {c}\n")
        f.write(f"{q}\n")
        for u, v in queries:
            f.write(f"{u} {v}\n")

def main(out_dir):
    if not os.path.exists(out_dir):
        os.makedirs(out_dir)

    num_cases = 10
    
    for i in range(1, num_cases + 1):
        # ensuring maximum vertices and maximum queries for stress testing
        n = 100000
        q = 100000
        edges, queries = generate_test_case(n, q)
        filepath = os.path.join(out_dir, f'test_{i:02}.in')
        write_test_case(filepath, n, edges, q, queries)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python generate_tests.py <output_directory>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    out_dir = sys.argv[1]
    main(out_dir)
```

This script will generate 10 test cases with:
- `n = 100000` vertices in the tree
- `q = 100000` queries involving vertex pairs

The edges will be part of a balanced binary tree structure to ensure it's stress-tested for the worst-case scenario but still maintains the tree properties. Each edge weight will be a random value between 1 and `10**9`. The queries are also randomized to cover as many pairs as possible.

Here is how to use this script:

1. Save the script to a file named `generate_tests.py`.
2. Run the script from the terminal:
   ```sh
   python generate_tests.py <output_directory>
   ```

   Replace `<output_directory>` with the path of the directory where you want to generate the test case files.

Each test case will be saved in the specified directory as `test_01.in`, `test_02.in`, etc., containing the input format suitable for the problem described.
